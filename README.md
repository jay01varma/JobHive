# JobHive
 JobHive automates the process of finding job listings from popular job search websites such as Indeed, Mynimo, and JobStreet. With JobHive, you can specify your desired skills or job titles, location, and the number of pages to scrape, and it will collect relevant job opportunities for you. Say goodbye to manually browsing multiple websites for job openings â€” JobHive streamlines the job search process, saving you time and effort.

## Problem it Solves

Searching for job opportunities can be a time-consuming and daunting task, especially when you're looking across multiple websites. JobHive solves this problem by automating the process of finding job listings from various platforms. Instead of manually visiting each website and searching for jobs, JobHive allows users to specify their criteria once and scrape job listings from multiple websites in a single run. This saves time and effort, making the job search process more efficient and manageable.
